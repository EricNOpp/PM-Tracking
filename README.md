# PM-Tracking
This is a blank XL Sheet with Code that will generate a full Project Tracking Workbook

This spreadsheet application was a financial tracking spreadsheet that I used on the first project task that I ever had to manage.  The workbook itself proved to be a very useful tool in keeping track of the current financial status of a task and/or an entire project.  This same workbook also proved to be very handy for creating a basis of estimate or a price quote for new work.  

I created a VBA application that would automatically generate a complete workbook from an empty spreadsheet and that would facilitate those small tasks that were done manually before so as to reduce the numbers of errors injected into the workbook as its was being used.  The spreadsheet can fit a full five years.  In principle, the number of years included in the application could be extended indefinitely, but I have seen very few projects, whose periods of performance extend beyond five years â€“ particularly in the Government contracting arena.  

The instructions (pre-update schedule for the future) are based on an old version of XL, but the bulk of the usage instructions still make sense irrespective of which version of XL you are using.

There is a blank copy of the Project Financial Tracker Workbook/Application in this repository.  Since the application itself will be creating new worksheets and modifying the contents of those worksheets based upon the project parameters entered into the application, I would recommend that you copy the application to your local hard disk in a location that you can use it as a template.  I would further set the file parameters to be read-only, so that you do not inadvertently save a full project workbook over the blank application.  

In case you are interested in looking at or modifying the code, the Password for the VBA Code is:

I have purposefully password protected the code so that it does not get inadvertently modified.

I have added three additional files to the repository, which represent a completed example of a full project plan.  The three files are:
1. Demo Run 2.xls
2. PMI Project Estimation.ppx
3. Instructions on Rerunning the PMFin Tracker Demoonstration.doc

The last file is not completely accurate, since there are bindings to <cntl> keys that are no longer valid, but the general approach should still work.
